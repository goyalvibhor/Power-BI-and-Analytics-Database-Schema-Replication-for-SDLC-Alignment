# Power-BI-and-Analytics-Database-Schema-Replication-for-SDLC-Alignment

**Executive Summary**

This project addresses the need to align Power BI and analytics efforts with the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) by replicating the production analytics database schema across lower environments (Test3/Dev, Test2/QA, Test1/Dev). This ensures consistency and facilitates seamless development, testing, and quality assurance processes.

**Business Problem**

Inconsistencies between the production analytics database and lower environments can lead to errors in reporting, analysis, and testing. By replicating the schema, we mitigate these risks and improve the reliability of data-driven decision-making.

**Methodology**

Establish Connection: Securely connect to the production analytics database (sql-clinone-test) using defined credentials.

**Schema Replication:**

Create identical schemas (cta, ctc, dev, scratch, TEST) in the lower environments to mirror the production structure.
Utilize external tables to reference the data in the production database, ensuring real-time updates and avoiding data duplication.
Optionally, create views to provide specific data perspectives for reporting and analysis.
Validation: Verify the successful replication of the schema and data access in each lower environment.

**Skills**

**Database Management**: SQL Server (T-SQL) for schema creation, data source management, and external table definition.
**Power BI**: Understanding of Power BI's integration with external data sources and the importance of schema consistency.
**SDLC**: Knowledge of software development lifecycle principles to ensure proper integration of database changes.
Results & Business Recommendation

The successful replication of the production analytics database schema across lower environments offers several benefits:

**Reduced Errors**: Minimizes discrepancies between environments, leading to more accurate reporting and analysis.
**Improved Testing**: Enables comprehensive testing of Power BI reports and analytics in environments that closely resemble production.
**Streamlined Development**: Developers can work with confidence, knowing that their changes will be compatible with the production environment.
**Enhanced Collaboration**: Consistent schemas facilitate collaboration between development, testing, and BI teams.
It is recommended to incorporate this schema replication process into the regular SDLC procedures to maintain data consistency and reliability throughout the development lifecycle. Regular monitoring and validation should be implemented to ensure ongoing alignment between the environments.
